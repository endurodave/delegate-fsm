/// @brief A thread-safe timer class that provides periodic or one-shot callbacks.
///
/// @details
/// The Timer class allows clients to register for callbacks (`OnExpired`) that are invoked
/// when a specified timeout interval elapses.
///
/// **Key Features:**
/// * **Thread Safe:** All public API methods (`Start`, `Stop`, etc.) are thread-safe and can be called
///   from any thread.
/// * **Flexible Modes:** Supports both one-shot (`once = true`) and periodic (`once = false`) operation.
/// * **Deterministic Execution:** Callbacks are invoked on the thread that calls `ProcessTimers()`.
///   This allows the user to control exactly which thread executes the timer logic (e.g., Main Thread,
///   GUI Thread, or a dedicated Worker Thread).
///
/// **Usage — Preferred Pattern:**
/// Call `ProcessTimers()` from the highest-priority context that can preempt all watched threads —
/// typically a hardware timer ISR or the highest-priority task in the system. Connect `OnExpired`
/// to one of:
///   - A plain (synchronous) delegate for inline, fast callbacks (no blocking, no allocation).
///   - An async delegate (`MakeDelegate(..., thread)`) to dispatch work to a worker thread.
///     The target thread MUST use `FullPolicy::FAULT` or `FullPolicy::DROP` — never `TIMEOUT`.
///     (`FAULT` crashes immediately if the queue is full, making overflow visible during testing;
///      `DROP` silently skips the dispatch, which is acceptable for periodic heartbeats.)
///
/// **ProcessTimers() Blocking Invariant:**
/// `ProcessTimers()` MUST NEVER block. Violating this starves the timer subsystem and defeats
/// the watchdog. Three known causes:
///
///   **Cause 1 — Async dispatch to a TIMEOUT-policy thread:**
///   `MakeDelegate(fn, thread)()` inside a timer callback calls `DispatchDelegate()` on the
///   target thread. If that thread's queue is full and its policy is `FullPolicy::TIMEOUT`,
///   `ProcessTimers()` stalls for up to `dispatchTimeout` (default 2 s). Fix: target threads
///   that receive timer dispatches must use `FAULT` or `DROP`, never `TIMEOUT`.
///
///   **Cause 2 — DelegateAsyncWait connected to OnExpired:**
///   `DelegateAsyncWait` blocks its caller until the target thread returns the result.
///   If one is connected to `OnExpired`, `ProcessTimers()` blocks indefinitely waiting
///   for the remote call to complete. Fix: never connect `DelegateAsyncWait` to a timer signal.
///   Only plain async delegates (`MakeDelegate(..., thread)`) are safe for timer callbacks.
///
///   **Cause 3 — Slow synchronous callback:**
///   A plain (non-async) delegate connected to `OnExpired` runs inline inside `ProcessTimers()`.
///   If that function acquires a lock, does I/O, or otherwise takes significant time,
///   `ProcessTimers()` is delayed for that duration. Fix: keep synchronous timer callbacks fast;
///   dispatch any slow work asynchronously to a worker thread instead.
///
/// @see SafeTimer.cpp for examples on how to handle callbacks safely with object lifetimes.
